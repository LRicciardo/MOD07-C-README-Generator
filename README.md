    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

Me, Myself, and I. Me and Myself helped out with the ideas and setup but I did most of the work. I sought help from MDN, GitHub, and other areas of the internet, referred back to class notes and videos, and had an assist from my tutor, Erik. Thank you, Erik.

## Features

The major feature is Modularity. In the future, I would like to modularize the individual sections of the README.
